# MES-Big-Data-Analysis-Real-Case-Study
This is a Capstone project, we were very lucky having the apportunity to help a factory to kick off the analytical journey on the MES data after a year of implementation of MES.
The data size is 3GB. The MES is on the production line of assembly of heart valves.
We manage the project by planning the into phases. 

Phase 1: Understanding and desecting the data. And very important is understanding of the Processes. Communicating the the subject matter experts will be the key success of the project.

Phase 2: Create data visualisation to help summarize the data into 3 dashboards:  Productivity, Quailty and Production Performance. The visualization help to summarized the data and help to identify the area of improvements. And a important tool to explain to the stakeholders what is happening.

Phase 3: Using Python to investigate the insight of opportunity to reduce the cycle time. 

Phase 4: Optimising the cycle time with quality. And suggestion and grouping the employee as a solution with machine learning group the one thousand employee.
